# Problem 
## The student
Whilst online tutorials has made learning extremely accessible, it lacks the interactivity and fun that a group based learning environment can provide.

Learning from a video or text based tutorial can be a singular and lonely endeavor whilst learning in groups, despite how trivial or disposable the skill, can be exciting and socially advantageous.

Often people who want to learn or try a skill seldom have the time and resources to attend a long drawn out class delivered course. This is assuming they even find a relevant course in the first place. For example, if I wanted to try my hand at making strawberry jam, the chances of finding a place or a person teaching this in your area could be challenging. The next best thing, the internet! Here you will find endless video tutorials on making jam, however you can't easily communicate with the teacher on where to get the best strawberries?, Where to buy the mason jars?, How much money can I sell the jam for in my area should I decide to go into business? Also lacking is the networking of like minded individuals. One of the biggest positives of group based learning is the networking possibilites and relationships you will create through social engagement. 

## The teacher
Millions of people around the world possess unique, interesting, sought after skills and experience. These skills can range from making amazing bread, to learning how to make your own jewelry. People with mastery of these skills have the potential to leverage and workshop them to paying students who are eager to learn. 

The individuals skill and experience is highly valuable, but often those who consider teaching find that there is no centralized system to advertise their knowledge as a service. Private education services that offer short courses can be rigid and expensive to register. Also, these institutions, depending on the course content, can be unaccomodating with course content that is on the fringe of a particular domain.

## The solution
Skillzee is a solution that connects those of us who want to learn a skill, with those of us who want to teach that skill. 
Skillzee will provide the eager student the ability to search through different courses based on category and location. Course and teacher information will be provided as well as a course average rating and comments from previous students. This encourages teachers to deliver exceptional quality and give students piece of mind when booking a course.

The focus of Skillzee is on interactive, organised, fun workshop style teaching where emphasis is placed on doing, rather than just sitting and listening.
