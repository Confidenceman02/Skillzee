# Problem 
## The student
Whilst online tutorials has made learning extremely accessible, it lacks the interactivity and fun that a group based learning environment can provide.

Learning from a video or text based tutorial can be a singular and lonely endeavor whilst learning in groups, despite how trivial or disposable the skill, can be exciting and socially advantageous.

Often people who want to learn or try a skill seldom have the time and resources to attend a long drawn out class delivered course. This is assuming they even find a relevant course in the first place. For example, if I wanted to try my hand at making strawberry jam, the chances of finding a place or a person teaching this in your area could be challenging. The next best thing, the internet! Here you will find endless video tutorials on making jam, however you can't easily communicate with the teacher on where to get the best strawberries?, Where to buy the mason jars?, How much money can I sell the jam for in my area should I decide to go into business? Also lacking is the networking of like minded individuals. One of the biggest positives of group based learning is the networking possibilites and relationships you will create through social engagement. 

## The teacher
Millions of people around the world possess unique, interesting, sought after skills and experience. These skills can range from making amazing bread, to learning how to make your own jewelry. People with mastery of these skills have the potential to leverage and workshop them to paying students who are eager to learn. 

The individuals skill and experience is highly valuable, but often those who consider teaching find that there is no centralized system to advertise their knowledge as a service. Private education services that offer short courses can be rigid and expensive to register. Also, these institutions, depending on the course content, can be unaccomodating with course content that is on the fringe of a particular domain.

## The solution
Skillzee is a solution that connects those of us who want to learn a skill, with those of us who want to teach that skill. 
Skillzee will provide the eager student the ability to search through different courses based on category and location. Course and teacher information will be provided as well as a course average rating and comments from previous students. This encourages teachers to deliver exceptional quality and give students piece of mind when booking a course.

The focus of Skillzee is on interactive, organised, fun workshop style teaching where emphasis is placed on doing, rather than just sitting and listening.

# The process
## 1. Database/wireframe
I spent a a decent amount of time on both the database schema and wireframe. I knew that these two elements would really hold the project back if I did not thoroughly set them up right so I gave them the respect they deserved.

In regards to the wireframe I had a very clear picture of what I wanted to achieve. I envisioned the app looking clean and professional but also friendly to use. 

The database schema did experience some iterations however I refrained from thinking too far ahead and designed it to fit the brief.

## 2. No scaffold
Whilst I wanted a fully desinged functioning app by the deadline I instead decided to take the opportunity to really understand how rails works. 
Not using scaffold at first was extremely stressful however it forced me to read extensively on rails and really grasp how rails passes messages around.

Progress was slow initially but when things started clicking a few days in, coding Skillzee became immensly satisfying. I was confidently adding features, utilizing partials and interacting with the database.

Best of all I spent a considerable amount of time helping my fellow students. It felt nice be able help dig some students out of trouble.

## 3. Styling
Whilst the brief didn't ask for extensive styling, I had an extremely difficult time looking at the dull defualt aesthetics that rails provides. I adopted a method where I completed a particular feature, then I would add some minor styling. This allowed me to truly embrace the full stack and provide variety when coding the app. By the end a large chunk of my styling had been done, which made adding extra styling a breeze!

## 4. Dependencies
I used shrine and AWS-S3 to handle my image uploads, these were both extremely painful to set up, largely a result of my inexperience. Many lessons learned here and very glad I went throught the process. I feel I could set up amazon and shrine fairly easily now.

Sendgrid was used to handle mailing functions. Heroku provided and easy to follow guide to set this up.

Stripe handles payments, and there was issues setting this up, again due to inexperience.

# Some final words
To think 13 weeks ago I couldnt code a single thing, to now creating the beginnings of Skillzee, truly blows my mind. I have honestly fallen in love with the creativity and usefulness of web development. This project has awakened the beast!
